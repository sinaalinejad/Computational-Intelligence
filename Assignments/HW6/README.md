## Using Genetic Algorithm to find the answer to polynomial equations (q2.ipynb)  
Main steps:  
- Specifying Fitness function
- Specifying the Selection method (here tournament selection)
- Specifying the Crossover method (here blend crossover)
- Specifying the Mutation method (here gaussian mutation)
- Defining Initial population
- Running the algorithm through specified number of generations

I used deap library to build the mentioned process.
